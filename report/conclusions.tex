\section{Conclusions}
\label{section:conclusion}

In this short document we advertised Python based implmentation of the 
Wireguard protocol to the interested reader. We have tested the protocol using a pair of 
Ubuntu servers and measured the throughput. All in all, we have 
obtained a maximum of 70Mb/s between a pair of Wireguard peers, 
which we believe is sufficient for most use cases involving 
clients communicating over DSL, ADLS, 100Mb/s Ethernet and the 
like. We have exposed our proof-of-a-concept implementation of 
Wireguard protocol using Python language in our GitHub repository.
Interesting reader can find it here~\cite{wireguard:poci}.
