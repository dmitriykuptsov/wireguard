Wireguard~\cite{wireguard} is a novel security protocol which allows for building secure Virtual Private Networks
on top of layer 3. Wireguard uses the notion of a cryptorouting in which the forwarding of a packet 
occures based on public key of a peer. Wireguard is 1-RTT protocol, meaning that it requires 
(in the best case) single round-trip to negotiate the keys for securing the data plane traffic.
In addition Wireguard introduces the concept of cryptographic cookies which can be used 
during the heavy load time instants to protect the server from denial-of-service attacks.
Finally, Wireguard uses latest cryptographic algorithms such as Authenticated Encryption
with Authentication Data (AEAD) ChaCha20 algorithm and compact $256$ bit elliptic curve 
X25519.

In what follows we will describe the setup of Wireguard between two nodes deploed on 
virutual machines.
